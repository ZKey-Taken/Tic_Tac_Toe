A simple Tic Tac Toe Game made with Java and Swing.

It's not perfect as it can only run once every time.
Doesn't have a database to record/remember the history of each player's wins.

Run the main() function in the Gamerunner class to start the game.
Board and Player classes are used to make the game, there's nothing to run inside those.
