# A simple Tic Tac Toe Game made with Java and Swing


**Description**

It's not perfect as it can only run once every time.
Doesn't have a database to record/remember the history of each player's wins.


**How to start the Game**

Run the main() function in the Gamerunner class to start the game.
Board and Player classes are used to make the game, there's nothing to run inside those.


**Once the Game starts**

Once the game starts, it prompts you to enter both players' names. Then press start, another window would pop up and the game would start. Player 1 would always start first then it switches turns, player 1 would be red and player 2 would be blue. Once 3 in a roll exist (horizontally/vertically/diagonally), the game would end and a player would be notified. If you want to start again, simply close the game and rerun main().
